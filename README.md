## NodeDockerApp

This application consists of the frontend and backend parts.
* Frontend is written with help of the Vue.js framework. (Vite is used to launch
  front end part of this application).
* Backend is written using Node.js and Express (api).
* Database is MySQL. Also, I use Adminer to manage mySQL.

I was working with Docker Node application
while studying Docker and Docker Compose.
